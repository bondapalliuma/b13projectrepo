 
GIT CONFLICT/MERGE CONFLICT:
----------------------------

THIS ARISES WHEN THE FILE NAME IS SAME BUT THE CONTENT OR CODE INSIDE THE FILE IS DIFFERENT.

SAME FILENAMES eg:
-------------------

feature1.java    |   feature1.java

f1.py   |  f1.py

abhi  |  abhi

if the data or code in the above filename types are different then merge conflict or git conflict arrives.
in this scenarios developers need to connect and resolve the issue manually, because the code has been developed by developers.
=======================

DIFFERENT FILENAMES eg:
-----------------------

feature1.java  | feature1.py

f1  | F1

In the above file names scenarios there will not be any merge conflicts if the code is different.
